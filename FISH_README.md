## Exploring Fish Data Through Filtering

This section demonstrates how the script filters the fish dataset based on specific criteria, such as species, site, and year. For example, the script filters for fish with the common name "garibaldi" or those observed at the "mohk" site. Filtering allows us to focus on specific subsets of the data for targeted analysis.

## Combining Fish and Kelp Data


This section showcases the joining of fish and kelp datasets using various join types, such as `full_join()`, `left_join()`, and `inner_join()`. By combining these datasets, we can analyze the relationship between fish populations and kelp abundance, providing insights into ecosystem dynamics.

## Visualizing Fish Counts and Kelp Fronds



This section highlights the visualization of the relationship between fish count and kelp fronds using `ggplot2`. The scatter plot provides insights into the distribution of fish counts relative to kelp fronds, with different colors representing different fish species. Visualizations help us better understand patterns and trends in the data.
